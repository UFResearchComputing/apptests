# rcapptests

rcapptests stands for Research Computing Application Tests. This tool uses an environment modules
system (Lmod is currently supported) to generate a list of all environment modules on a computing
cluster and runs scheduled jobs on the same cluster to regularly test installed applications. A
collection of test/example data and standardized job scripts is needed to run the tests.

# Development
Use the requirements.txt to install dependencies, for instance, in a conda environment.
